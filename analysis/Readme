The scripts given in the Juypter notebooks are "demo" versions with example data or input files in the "example_data" sub-folder. 
Scripts should work in windows/mac/linux.
Python is required to run the scripts (except for hammDist.m , a Matlab function).

Each notebook perform a given function with the exception of one notebook mentioned below.

mCREATE_supplementary_analysis.ipynb
This is a compilation of codes performing multiple functions. 
Each cell is a separate function and the relevant functions are mentioned on top of every cell. 
The users are required to choose the functions/cells they want and run them separately.

The time required to run these scripts are in the order of 2-5 mins depending on the length of the dataset.

 
Brief decription:
Primer_generator_for_11mer_clones_587-590AAV9.ipynb
This script generates 2 overlapping forward and reverse primers for AAV variants where 11 codons are modified from the parent 
(as described in the RavindraKumar et al 2019 manuscript, Methods section (unpublished)). These primers are used for cloning AAV variants.

Reverse_primer_generator_11mer-spikein_synthetic_lib.ipynb
This script generates 1 reverse primer and 1 reverse primer with alternate mammalian codon for synthesizing 11 codon modified 
Spike-in library oligopool. This is then sent to Twist Bioscience for oligopool synthesis.

Reverse_primer_generator_7mer_synthetic_lib.ipynb
This script generates 1 reverse primer and 1 reverse primer with alternate mammalian codon for synthesizing 7 codon modified 
588-89 library oligopool. This is then sent to Twist Bioscience for oligopool synthesis.

heatmap_588-89+library.ipynb
This script generates a heatmap of amino acid distribution in the diversified region. 
The raw data is subjected to codon frequency normalization and the standard score is plotted as a heatmap 
(with options to generate heatmaps before and after normalization).

hammDist.m
This script is a Matlab function that generates a .txt list of paired sequences with their reverse hamming distance, 
i.e. number of positions with identical AA. Output may be visualized in Cytoscape software. 
Script was run on MATLAB R2017b (9.3.0.7135779), 64-bit (maci64).
